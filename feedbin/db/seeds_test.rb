  { :feed_id => 1, :title => "★ The Case for a New Lower-Cost iPhone", :url => "http://daringfireball.net/2013/08/the_case_for_a_new_lower_cost_iphone", :author => "John Gruber", :summary => "Lost amid much of the rampant speculation that Apple is on the cusp of unveiling a...", :content => "<p>Lost amid much of the rampant speculation that Apple is <a href=\"http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/08/12/apples-rumored-september-10-iphone-event/\">on the cusp</a> of unveiling a new plastic-bodied lower-priced iPhone &#8220;5C&#8221; is the simple fact that Apple has offered lower-priced iPhones for several years now &#8212; year-old and two-year-old models. So the question to ask is not &#8220;Does Apple need a lower-cost iPhone?&#8221;, but rather, &#8220;Why would Apple change its lower-cost iPhone strategy from selling years-old high-end models to a new model designed from the get-go to sell at lower prices?&#8221; I.e. why change now?</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake: Apple&#8217;s current strategy has been remarkably successful. They sell a ton of iPhone 4S and 4 devices, and have expanded the iOS market by doing so. But there are several factors this year that suggest a change in strategy.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple does unveil an iPhone 5C, I expect them to concurrently abandon the iPhones 4 and 4S. Their three pricing tiers for the next year would be a new iPhone 5S at the high end, today&#8217;s iPhone 5 in the mid-range, and the new 5C at the low end.<sup id=\"fnr1-2013-08-13\"><a href=\"#fn1-2013-08-13\">1</a></sup> This way, all new iPhones would sport 16:9 aspect ratio displays, and all would have Lightning adapter ports. Adios both to 3:2 displays and the grody old 30-pin port.<sup id=\"fnr2-2013-08-13\"><a href=\"#fn2-2013-08-13\">2</a></sup> </p>\n\n<p>The other factor is that I think Apple needs to push the low end of the iPhone lineup even lower. Today they&#8217;re primarily selling the low end models as free-with-contract devices. Apple has no iPhone that competes well in non-subsidized markets. In the U.S. and other subsidized markets, I expect the 5C to be sold just like the iPhone 4 is today: &#8220;free&#8221; with a contract. But in non-subsidized markets, I expect the 5C to sell at lower prices than an unsubsidized iPhone 4 does today.</p>\n\n<p>How low? Well, ever since 2007 and the original iPod Touch, it&#8217;s always seemed to me that the Touch suggests a floor for a hypothetical lower-priced iPhone. Take an iPod Touch and add cellular networking components. Boom, there&#8217;s your lower-priced iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>With the iPad, Apple charges quite a premium for cellular models &#8212; they cost $130 more than the corresponding Wi-Fi-only models. Apply that to today&#8217;s iPod Touch lineup and you&#8217;d get a 32 GB low-cost iPhone for $299 + $130 = $429. But there&#8217;s also that 16 GB Touch for just $229. Part of the cost savings on that device is that it doesn&#8217;t even have a rear-facing camera. And I&#8217;ve never believed that the $130 premium for cellular iPads is entirely related to component and assembly costs; I think Apple charges a premium for cellular iPads because they know many people are willing to pay that premium.</p>\n\n<p>All told, I think Apple could build and sell an iPod Touch-caliber iPhone 5C for $399, possibly as low as $349.</p>\n\n<p>Would this cannibalize sales of the actual iPod Touch? Perhaps, but modern-era Apple has never been afraid of cannibalizing its own products. But don&#8217;t underestimate the Touch &#8212; thinner and lighter is still appealing for many customers, and the Touch has always been thinner and lighter than the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>A better question is whether the 5C might cannibalize sales of the 5S (and 5, if it stays around as a mid-tier model). If Apple is functioning properly, this shouldn&#8217;t be a concern. I expect the 5S to offer performance and camera upgrades that should clearly set it apart from a 5C model with iPod Touch-caliber specs. The camera alone might be worth the difference. The long-rumored fingerprint-scanner-built-into-the-home-button would be another.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#8217;d consider a red flag, a sign that perhaps we should start being worried about post-Jobs Apple, would be if Apple crippled the software on the 5C to diminish it against the 5 and 5S. <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/08/13/analyst-predicts-no-siri-on-iphone-5c-fingerprint-scanner-solely-for-device-unlocking-on-iphone-5s/\">Analyst Gene Munster predicts just that</a>, though:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In terms of the phone itself, we expect the cheaper phone to have\na plastic casing, 4&#8221; display, and lower end internal specs\n(processor, camera, memory, etc.) than the 5S/5 line up.\nAdditionally, we believe that Apple may exclude some software\nfeatures, such as Siri, which we note was not an option on the\niPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 upon launch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think, or at least hope, Munster is wrong. Apple can withhold cutting edge software features from <em>old</em> devices; they can&#8217;t do that for brand-new ones. There can be no penalty for buying a lower-priced iPhone 5C, only rewards for splurging on the higher-priced models, and those rewards should revolve around hardware (camera quality, CPU speed, fingerprint sensor, etc.). The 5C is not about selling a piece of junk to some sort of unwashed masses; it&#8217;s about continuing to push the price down to expand the iPhone&#8217;s market without changing what the iPhone brand stands for. Siri is now a big part of that brand. If Apple thinks the iPhone 5S needs &#8220;protection&#8221;, then the 5S (and Apple itself) has problems.</p>\n\n<p>If the 5S isn&#8217;t appealing enough based on hardware alone to compete against the 5C, then so be it. At least people buying a 5C are still buying an iPhone. But I don&#8217;t expect the 5S to have any such problems.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2013-08-13\">\n<p>I have no idea whether &#8220;5S&#8221; and &#8220;5C&#8221; are the actual names of the new iPhones Apple is poised to announce, but history makes 5S look like a good bet, and 5C sounds like a good name for a plastic iPhone that comes in an array of colors.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2013-08-13\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2013-08-13\">\n<p>If I&#8217;m right, this would leave the iPad 2 as the last device with a 30-pin port.

I did mention iPhone and Android, but only as one example of Google following the lead of others, commoditizing existing markets, the opposite of Larry Page&#8217;s onstage edict that &#8220;We should be building great things that don’t exist.&#8221;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now with Apple as the most successful company in the world, they\nstill can&#8217;t shake the amygdala urge to fight anyone in their space\nas an enemy. Case in point, John Gruber refers to anyone who\ncriticizes Apple in the slightest as a jackass, if you run a\nsearch restricted to Daring Fireball for that keyword, the search\nresults are ten pages long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have indeed used &#8220;jackass&#8221; to describe numerous people over the years, including a stretch circa 2006-2007 when I regularly named a &#8220;Jackass of the Week&#8221;. But I strongly believe that a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:daringfireball.net+jackass\">perusal of the DF archive</a> would show that I have never used the word jackass to describe &#8220;anyone who criticizes Apple in the slightest&#8221;. There are indeed many search results on Daring Fireball for &#8220;jackass&#8221;, but I regret almost none of them. I&#8217;ve used the word very deliberately, and I hope consistently, to describe people who are, in fact, jackasses. To call a jackass a jackass may be impolite, but it is not inaccurate or unfair.</p>\n\n<p>My dictionary defines <em>jackass</em>, in the non-donkey sense, merely as &#8220;a stupid person&#8221;. To my mind, the word also conveys a sense of willfulness &#8212; to be not merely stupid but willfully stupid. In many cases, I&#8217;ve used it to describe people who wrote stupid things that I suspect they did not actually believe to be true, but that they wrote these stupid things to be purposefully sensational, to draw attention to themselves and to their writing.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of no better word than <em>jackass</em> to describe, to name one recent example, Peter Cohan of Forbes, who has <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/01/cohan-jackass\">argued</a> (<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/22/cohan-forbes\">repeatedly</a>) that Apple&#8217;s board of directors should fire Tim Cook. First, that&#8217;s a preposterously stupid idea. Second, I suspect that Cohan himself knows that it&#8217;s a stupid idea, and that he makes this argument only because making such an argument with an ostensibly straight face draws a lot of attention. He either honestly believes Apple&#8217;s board should fire Tim Cook, or he&#8217;s purposefully wasting his readers&#8217; attention with an argument he knows to be sensational nonsense. Either way, he&#8217;s a jackass.</p>\n\n<p>That said, a perusal of my use of the word <em>jackass</em> on DF will also show that I have used the term much less frequently over the last several years, despite the fact that jackassery (Apple-related or otherwise) is more rampant than ever. It was easier for me to use strong words like <em>jackass</em> years ago, when I was writing in relative obscurity, than it is today. Daring Fireball&#8217;s popularity creates the perception that my calling someone a jackass is not calling a spade a spade &#8212; which is always and only what I&#8217;ve intended &#8212; but rather a form of bullying &#8212; which is clearly how Cromwell, for example, sees it.</p>\n\n<p>My tendency toward bluntness, however warranted by the facts, results in a loss of persuasion among those who confuse bluntness with shrillness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To a siege mentality, everything is zero sum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, I reiterate, my piece that Cromwell is referring to had almost nothing to do with Apple. It really was just about Google, and what I perceive to be their institutional hypocrisy and self-deception. Google is the company that has pitted itself as a rival to every other major player in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Rational followers, customers, and even fans of Apple are not concerned in the least that Apple will any day soon again &#8220;teeter on the brink&#8221;. (As a point of fact, the company &#8220;teetered on the brink&#8221; just once, from 1996-97, and with the exception of a few hiccup quarters, have been remarkably successful ever since.) In fact, close followers of Apple should be more concerned not with Apple <em>losing</em> its powerful position atop the industry, but rather with their <em>abusing</em> it.</p>\n\n<p>One recent example: this bit, exposed during the e-book price-fixing trial (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/technology/us-now-paints-apple-as-ringmaster-in-its-lawsuit-on-e-book-price-fixing.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">as reported by the New York Times</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In July 2010, Mr. Jobs, Apple’s former chief executive, told the\nchief executive of Random House, Markus Dohle, that the publisher\nwould suffer a loss of support from Apple if it held out much\nlonger, according to an account of the conversation provided by\nMr. Dohle in the filing. Two months later, Apple threatened to\nblock an e-book application by Random House from appearing in\nApple’s App Store because it had not agreed to a deal with Apple,\nthe filing said.</p>\n\n<p>After Random House finally agreed to a contract on Jan. 18, 2011,\nEddy Cue, the Apple executive in charge of its e-books deals, sent\nan e-mail to Mr. Jobs attributing the publisher’s capitulation, in\npart, to “the fact that I prevented an app from Random House from\ngoing live in the app store,” the filing reads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I find that worrisome. Not merely because it&#8217;s unfair (though it is; apps submitted to Apple&#8217;s App Store ought to be judged solely on their own merit) but because it is unhealthy. A new endeavor, such as the iBookstore, should be able to succeed on its own, without any unfair help from a separate Apple property such as the App Store. This path leads to hubris, and hubris inevitably leads to a fall.<sup id=\"fnr1-2013-06-20\"><a href=\"#fn1-2013-06-20\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Steve Jobs once said: &#8220;We did not enter the search business. They\nentered the phone business. Make no mistake they want to kill the\niPhone. We won&#8217;t let them. This &#8216;don&#8217;t be evil&#8217; mantra is\nbullshit.&#8221; In this world, competition is about utterly destroying\nyour enemy until they no longer exist, it&#8217;s evil, and Google and\nApple were somehow supposed to have an unspoken &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s\nagreement&#8221; not to pursue each other&#8217;s markets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;Somehow supposed to&#8221;? Eric Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board of directors.<sup id=\"fnr2-2013-06-20\"><a href=\"#fn2-2013-06-20\">2</a></sup> There&#8217;s no &#8220;somehow&#8221; or &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s agreement&#8221; about it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Larry Page is right, competition need not be a zero sum game,\nespecially in circumstances where the market is growing. Note that\nwhile iPhone and Android are brutally battling it out in the\nsmartphone market, both Apple, Google, and Samsung have all been\nenjoying year over year increases in earnings and user base. Yes,\nNokia and Blackberry lost out, but that&#8217;s mostly because feature\nphones as a category are dying, and iPhone class smartphones were\nlaunched by them too late.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, as far as Apple vs Android, so far, it has been positive\nsum for the two biggest fighters in the ring. Apple&#8217;s biggest\nproblem at this point is not Android, but saturation and overly\nhigh expectations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Agreed. But, <em>again</em>, I repeat, I never said that Apple&#8217;s biggest problem is Android, nor that competition need be a zero sum game. The gist of my piece was not that Apple is good and Google is bad. The gist of my argument is that Google is a ruthless competitor that enters existing markets, upends them, and isolates itself with a seemingly unquenchable desire to dominate every single market in consumer online services; yet, hypocritically, its leadership describes Google as just wanting to get along, that Google is institutionally a <em>nice</em> company, and that they succeed by &#8220;building great things that don’t exist&#8221;, whereas what they actually do is build free versions of things that already exist and make money selling ads.<sup id=\"fnr3-2013-06-20\"><a href=\"#fn3-2013-06-20\">3</a></sup> Google employees self-identify as not-ruthless while acting ruthlessly, leading to cognitive dissonance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gruber and others like to imagine that people who work at Google\nhate hate hate Apple products and want to destroy them, and that\nmay be the mentality on the Apple side, but I don&#8217;t know many\nGooglers who spend time trying to devise plans to destroy the\niPhone, many of them quite like iPads and use MacBooks and would\nbe sad to see Apple fold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no chance that Apple is going to &#8220;fold&#8221;. No one is worried about that. That&#8217;s a very weird thought to have even occurred to Cromwell. And nobody thinks Google employees &#8220;hate&#8221; Apple products; it&#8217;s common knowledge that many use iPhones (<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/17/mayer-roundup\">including executives</a>) and many more use Macs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As Larry said, much of the focus is on problem solving, not being\nconcerned with &#8220;destroying&#8221; competitors like you&#8217;d read in\ninternal Microsoft memos. The world has perhaps never seen a\ncorporation with management and culture like Google before in this\nsector, they can&#8217;t process it, and the cynic has to suspect it&#8217;s\nall bullshit, all a show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider the industry landscape today. Apple just announced iOS 7; it adds support at the system level for Flickr and Vimeo (in addition to Facebook and Twitter, which came last year). iOS 7 gets weather, sports, and financial news from Yahoo. Siri now integrates with Bing &#8212; Microsoft! &#8212; for web and image search results. Who are Google&#8217;s allies and partners? What services does Android or Chrome OS include at the system level except Google&#8217;s own?</p>\n\n<p>Apple frequently highlights third-party apps in TV commercials and in marketing photos for its devices. When&#8217;s the last time Google has promoted third-party apps for Android? Have they ever?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Speaking of solving problems and doing stuff that&#8217;s never been\ndone before, Gruber says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google\nPlus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after\nSpotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are\nnow just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better. Think\nabout even web search: Google search wasn’t something new; it was\nsomething better. Way, way, way better, but still.</p>\n\n<p>Consider maps. Google Maps entered a market where MapQuest and\nothers had been around for years. That wasn’t something great that\ndidn’t already exist. It was a better version of something that\nalready existed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the trick here? Google didn&#8217;t do anything that was&#8217;t done\nbefore. Gmail, Maps, Search, etc. Those are just refinements. But\nthe iPhone? That&#8217;s an entirely new thing from wholecloth. We won&#8217;t\nsay &#8220;the iPhone came after the Blackberry, after the Nokia\nSmartphones, after the PalmPhones&#8221;, we&#8217;ll just pretend they never\nexisted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly, I disagree with Cromwell almost entirely, but up until this point, I have tried to at least give him the benefit of the doubt in terms of his earnestness. But at this point it&#8217;s hard not to suspect that he&#8217;s just trolling.</p>\n\n<p>It was Larry Page who said, on stage at I/O:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every story I read about Google is “us versus some other company”\nor some stupid thing, and I just don’t find that very interesting.\nWe should be building great things that don’t exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suppose technically Page didn&#8217;t claim that Google actually <em>does</em> build great things that don&#8217;t exist, only that they (and everyone in attendance) <em>should</em>. But the implication certainly is there.</p>\n\n<p>Of course Apple didn&#8217;t invent the smartphone. No one thinks they did; no one has ever claimed they did. That includes Apple. In fact, Steve Jobs specifically and joyfully cited all of the predecessors cited by Cromwell during the iPhone&#8217;s introduction in 2007. He even showed them off:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/misc/2010/03/smartphones.jpg\">\n<img\n    src=\"/misc/2010/03/smartphones-415.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Steve Jobs at Macworld Expo 2007, showing the leading smartphones prior to the iPhone.\"\n/></a></p>\n\n<p>Nothing better exemplifies what Apple does best: enter an existing market with a product that blows the competition away, through superior design and engineering.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When does executing on something so radically better count as\n&#8220;never been done before&#8221;? Gmail and Maps were some of the first in\na new class of Web 2.0 applications, a whole new class of\ninteractivity for a web app. Do Google&#8217;s datacenters counter as\nhaving never been done before? Co-loc points for hosting servers\ngo back to the first dot.com boom, but to compare one of those\nwith the way Google&#8217;s Datacenters are engineered as just refining\nis completely ignoring the depth to which Google reinvented the\ndatacenter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with every word of this. Google&#8217;s success in these markets is based on the superiority of their offerings: the best web search, the best webmail, the best maps. <em>Enter an existing market with an overwhelmingly superior and hard-to-duplicate new product and destroy the competition.</em> That&#8217;s what Apple does, and that&#8217;s what Google does. That&#8217;s what almost all successful companies do. But it&#8217;s Page who expresses disinterest in and considers &#8220;stupid&#8221; stories that pit Google &#8220;versus some other company&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>The difference with Google is not the competitiveness, it&#8217;s the hypocrisy of denying the competitiveness. It feels trite to accuse Cromwell of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection\">projection</a>, but if there&#8217;s a company and its &#8220;fans&#8221; who are engaged in a &#8220;siege mentality&#8221;, it&#8217;s not Apple.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I for one am proud to be a googler because of things like the way\nLarry acquitted himself humbly, thoughtfully, and authentically at\nI/O. I&#8217;m glad he doesn&#8217;t engage in bitterness. Even if you think\nit&#8217;s fake spin, it&#8217;s still better than being an angry public\njackass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Uh, exactly?</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2013-06-20\">\n<p>When I linked to this NYT report a month ago, I quoted the same passage as above, but for my own commentary merely quipped, &#8220;Eddy Cue, hardball player.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, but it was lazy &#8212; and in hindsight I regret it, insofar as it does not suggest that I see this as the least bit troubling, when in fact I do.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2013-06-20\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2013-06-20\">\n<p>Perhaps Apple&#8217;s (and Steve Jobs&#8217;s) folly in this case &#8212; of Eric Schmidt serving on the Apple board while Google was working on Android &#8212; was not in trusting Schmidt to keep Android on track as a BlackBerry-like platform, but in thinking that this was even possible.

Whether he...", :content => "<p>No one has questioned whether Jony Ive can lead a hardware design team. Whether he could lead a software design team, however, has been the biggest question facing Apple over <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/forstall_out\">the last eight months</a>. In fact, it might be the biggest question facing Apple, ever, because it&#8217;s another way of asking whether the company could produce innovative software without you-know-who at the helm of the ship.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we have our answer, and it is a resounding yes. Jony Ive can lead a software team.</p>\n\n<p>The key, I think, is that his approach, and Apple&#8217;s as a whole under its post-Forstall organizational structure, is not to view this as two different things, hardware and software, but rather as a single thing: design.</p>\n\n<p>There is a deep intellectual rigor to the design of iOS 7, and it&#8217;s hard not to see it as being profoundly informed by Ive&#8217;s background in hardware. In hardware, design is limited by physics: weight, density, size, connections, seams. Software doesn&#8217;t face those design limits. The old design of iOS 6 took advantage of that lack of limits, to its detriment. In iOS 6, you open a folder on the home screen, and linen is something you see <em>underneath</em>. You pull down Notification Center, and linen is something you see <em>over</em>. It&#8217;s both over and under. Hardware doesn&#8217;t work like that, but software can, because software can show you anything, conceptual logic be damned.</p>\n\n<p>The design of iOS 7 is based on rules. There&#8217;s an intricate system at work, a Z-axis of layers organized in a logical way. There is a profound reduction in the use of faux-3D visual effects and textures, but iOS 7 is anything but flat. It is three dimensional not just visually but logically. It uses translucency not to show off, but to provide you with a sense of place. When you pull the new Control Center panel up from the bottom of the screen, its translucency lets you know that you haven&#8217;t gone somewhere new, you&#8217;re just looking at something <em>over</em> where you were.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a sense of place, depth, and spatiality in iOS 7 that makes it feel like hardware. A real thing, not pixels rendered on glass. It&#8217;s as though Ive has brought the same design goals that have always informed Apple&#8217;s hardware to software. And here, his team isn&#8217;t limited by physics. Planes can have zero thickness. But it&#8217;s a <em>system</em>, in the truest sense of the word.</p>\n\n<p>iOS 7 is not perfect; this new design framework will evolve and improve over time, just like iOS&#8217;s original aesthetic did. But it&#8217;s a conceptual foundation that corrects all of the excesses of the original iOS aesthetic. It&#8217;s radically different but not disorienting. Less flashy, less bling, more subtle, more refined. </p>\n\n<p>This is the first product of the post-Jobs Apple. The result shows that in some ways Apple&#8217;s software design has gotten <em>better</em>, because it was Jobs (and Forstall) who had a penchant for exuberant textures and gimmickry. Jobs&#8217;s taste in hardware was nearly perfect, but his taste in software <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/26/more-texture\">had a weakness for the saccharine</a>. Wood grain, linen, Rich Corinthian leather, etc. It was all just sugar for the eyes. This is a weakness Jony Ive’s software taste clearly does not suffer.</p>\n\n<p>The software is now of a piece with the hardware. Two sides of the same coin. Not hardware design and software design. Just design.</p>", :published => "2013-06-10 23:37:58", :updated => "2013-06-11 19:01:21", :created_at => "2013-08-24 12:41:15", :updated_at => "2013-08-24 12:41:15", :entry_id => "tag:daringfireball.net,2013://1.27795", :public_id => "dd6a8b622473b5eae04d8f3e644ef57afaec2b71", :old_public_id => "dd6a8b622473b5eae04d8f3e644ef57afaec2b71", :starred_entries_count => 0 },

Cook&#8217;s words to Mossberg were anything but empty. The most secretive company in the industry got more secretive. We know Jony Ive has been leading the software design of iOS and OS X. We can be pretty sure they&#8217;re going to show us what they&#8217;ve been up to. But no one seems to know just what that is. </p>\n\n<p>Yours truly included &#8212; and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. I haven&#8217;t been this in the dark about what Apple was set to announce in a keynote since the original iPhone introduction in January 2007. I&#8217;ve seen some speculation over the past few days that <a href=\"http://vesperapp.co/\">Vesper</a>&#8217;s UI was informed by advanced knowledge of iOS 7. It was not. In fact, if anything, I expect Apple to zig where we (Q Branch) have zagged, in some ways. (And if iOS 7&#8217;s reveal does make Vesper seem at least somewhat presciently designed, chalk it up simply to our being able to tell which way the design wind is blowing.)</p>\n\n<p>The thing to focus on &#8212; now, during the anticipatory lull, and tomorrow, once we have the actual design before us &#8212; is not merely what it looks like. The quote I keep coming back to is this classic from Steve Jobs, 10 years ago: &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Whatever has changed in iOS 7 has changed for reasons other than fashion, or difference for the sake of difference.</p>\n\n<p>The original iPhone was designed for a world where smartphones were horrid little button- and scroll-wheel-driven devices, and where proper humane computer interfaces were driven by mouse and trackpad cursors. The iPhone blended the two &#8212; the size and cellular networking of the smartphone, the humaneness of Mac-style UI design &#8212; and did so by introducing something new. The touchscreen.<sup id=\"fnr1-2013-06-09\"><a href=\"#fn1-2013-06-09\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The design of the iPhone software was entirely informed by the fact that this was a new experience, it was nothing like using an existing smartphone, nor anything like using a Mac or Windows PC. It needed training wheels to get people up to speed. Thus, to name one small example, why iOS buttons have tended to look so very button-y. To inform the user, as clearly as possible, that this is a button that can be tapped.</p>\n\n<p>Look around you. Any street corner. Any office. Any shopping mall. Any restaurant. You will see people tapping on touchscreens. We all get it now. iOS-style computing is no longer novel; it is now the standard interaction model for personal computing.</p>\n\n<p>The primary problem Apple faced with the iPhone in 2007 was building familiarity with a new way of using computers. That problem has now been solved. It is time to solve new problems.</p>\n\n<p>The training wheels can now come off. That&#8217;s what I think Apple&#8217;s going to do tomorrow.<sup id=\"fnr2-2013-06-09\"><a href=\"#fn2-2013-06-09\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2013-06-09\">\n<p>No, Apple did not invent the touchscreen.

There are two load balancers running nginx that handle SSL termination and load balancing. Both of these get used because DNS is hosted at Route 53 which offers <a href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring.html'>Active-Active DNS Failover</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a 4 GB memcached instance here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DigitalOcean</strong></p>\n\n<p>All feed refreshing is done in another datacenter. In this case <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/'>DigitalOcean</a> is being used. They provide low cost AND high performance virtual private servers and it&#8217;s fast to turn them on or off. The refresh job gets scheduled to a 16GB instance running Redis 2.6.14. There are 10 2GB 2 core instances running Sidekiq Pro that pick jobs off the queue. The job is simple but needs to run as quickly and as parallel as possible. It makes an HTTP request with if-modified-since and if-none-match headers to take advantage of HTTP caching. Then the feed is parsed using <a href='https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra'>feedzirra</a>. A unique id is generated for every entry in the feed and the existence of this id is checked against the redis database.</p>\n\n<p>The data structure for the ids in redis was inspired by this <a href='http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12202313862/storing-hundreds-of-millions-of-simple-key-value-pairs'>Instagram blog post</a> about efficiently storing millions of key value pairs.</p>\n\n<p>A unique id for an entry is a sha1 of a few different attributes of the entry. After an entry is imported a key is added to redis like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HSET &quot;entry:public_ids:e349a&quot; &quot;e349a4ec0bd033d81724cf9113f09b94267fe984&quot; &quot;1&quot;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the first 5 characters in the id hash creates a nice distribution of keys per hash. For 20,000,000 ids only about 1,000,000 redis keys are created. This means it gets to take advantage of <a href='http://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization'>redis hash memory efficiency</a>. I tried this with a few other data structures and found this to be the most efficient. For example storing the keys as a redis set took more than twice the memory.</p>\n\n<p>If it is determined that an entry is new the full entry is converted to JSON and inserted back into redis as a Sidekiq job where it can get imported by a background worker running at SoftLayer.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to <a href='mailto:ben@feedbin.me'>hear from you</a> if you have any questions or suggestions about the architecture.</p>", :published => "2013-06-28 07:00:00", :updated => nil, :created_at => "2013-08-24 12:46:51", :updated_at => "2013-08-24 12:46:51", :entry_id => "http://blog.feedbin.me/2013/06/28/full-metal-hosting", :public_id => "2675b036af75fd8ea5a48e9e10f0a9cc958376ee", :old_public_id => "2675b036af75fd8ea5a48e9e10f0a9cc958376ee", :starred_entries_count => 0 },

One important performance metric for databases is the <a href='http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/10/01/understanding-postgres-performance/'>percentage of the index that can be kept in memory</a>. This number should be as close to 100% as possible and over the last week, Feedbin&#8217;s had dropped to 94%. Time for an upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>The database upgrade went smoothly, taking only about 6 minutes. However immediately after bringing the site back up, there were many connection timeout errors in the logs. The frustrating part was that the timeouts seemed random. There was still plenty of traffic getting through, but for many people, including me, the site was completely inaccessible.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that stood out to me was how long database queries were taking after the upgrade, for some reason the new database was <em>slower</em> than the old one. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why this is, but I&#8217;m thinking that the database takes time to figure out what it needs to keep in its cache. I believe that connections were timing out due to how long the database was taking to respond.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry about any inconvenience this may have caused and will take extra precautions next time something as critical as the database is being upgraded.</p>", :published => "2013-04-06 07:00:00", :updated => nil, :created_at => "2013-08-24 12:46:51", :updated_at => "2013-08-24 12:46:51", :entry_id => "http://blog.feedbin.me/2013/04/06/downtime-today", :public_id => "8a50f28dd4df9020d4d4ec932bea38496eabae5b", :old_public_id => "8a50f28dd4df9020d4d4ec932bea38496eabae5b", :starred_entries_count => 0 },
